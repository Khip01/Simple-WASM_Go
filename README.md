Language: English

## Description:
  Just a little try to create simple WebAssembly using GO. 

## Structure
  So i'll explain my understanding about this project, here's the structure how WebAssembly GO Works:<br><br>
  
  >__Server__\
  path: ```server/main.go``` this is for the web server, wich will catch **address** and throw back some WebAssembly Component that will be display to user (In this implementation i use ```8081``` port). Just run this, and the server will be active.

  >__WebAssembly GO__\
  path: ```wasm/main.go``` this is for the WebAssembly code, wich we can build to ```.wasm``` file using:<br> ```GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o ../main.wasm```.

  All of these components is interrelated,<br>
  1. ```Client/User``` **--(sending request address)-->** ```server/main.go``` <br>
  Then server will preparing the WASM,<br>
  ```server/main.go``` **--(preparing)-->** ```WASM Component``` (index.html, script.js, main.wasm)

  2. WASM Preparing process: <br>
  ```index.html``` **--(get WASM action through js)-->** ```script.js``` **--(js Get WASM action)-->** ```main.wasm```

  3. And finally, <br>
  ```main.wasm``` will return some action to ```index.html``` through ```script.js``` so that client/user can receive the requested action in index.html
